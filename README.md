# UI Library

## Problem Statement

Developers often need to create UI components from scratch, which can be time-consuming and repetitive. Additionally, there is no easy way for developers to sell their UI components to others who may need them.

## Solution

Our UI library allows developers to upload their UI components and sell them to others. The library includes an in-built code editor, making it easy for developers to create and edit their components. We used Next.js for the frontend and backend, and Stripe for payment processing.

## Local Setup

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:
Clone the project

```bash
  git clone
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd frontend
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  pnpm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  pnpm run dev
```
