# UI Library

## Problem Statement
Lack of a centralized platform for developers to upload and sell their UI components. Currently, developers have to rely on various marketplaces or create their own websites to sell their components. This creates a fragmented market and makes it difficult for developers to reach a wider audience. Additionally, there is a lack of an in-built code editor, which makes it difficult for developers to create and edit their components. 

## Solution

Our UI library allows developers to upload their UI components and sell them to others. The library includes an in-built code editor, making it easy for developers to create and edit their components. We used Next.js for the frontend and backend, and Stripe for payment processing.

Developers can create an account on our platform and upload their UI components.They can set their own prices and earn money for each sale. Other developers can browse and purchase these components, and use them in their own projects.

Our in-built code editor allows developers to create and edit their components directly on our platform. This eliminates the need for external tools and streamlines the development process.

We used Next.js for the frontend and backend of our platform. Next.js is a popular framework for building server-side rendered React applications. It provides a great developer experience and makes it easy to build scalable applications.

We also used Stripe for payment processing. Stripe is a secure and reliable payment processing platform that allows us to handle payments from users all over the world.

Overall, our UI library provides a centralized platform for developers to upload and sell their UI components, with an in-built code editor and secure payment processing.
